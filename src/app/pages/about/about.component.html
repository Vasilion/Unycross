        <h3>Luke V.</h3>
        <p class="role">Founder & Developer</p>
        <p class="bio">
          I'm a senior web developer for the State of Michigan Senate with a
          passion for building custom web solutions that drive efficiency and
          innovation.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          With years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in
          creating tailored web applications, hosting solutions, and business
          software that meet the unique needs of clients.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          Beyond coding, I have a competitive edge that extends beyond the
          screenâ€”I was a multi-time All-American at Grand Valley State
          University and a state motocross champion in 2021.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          Whether it's developing cutting-edge software or racing on the track,
          I bring the same level of precision, dedication, and drive to
          everything I do.
