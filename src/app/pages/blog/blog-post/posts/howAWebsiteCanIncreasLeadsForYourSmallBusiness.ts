    convert visitors into leads.

    Over
    <strong>68% of online experiences begin with a search engine</strong>
    (BrightEdge, 2024). If your business ranks on Google, you're more likely to
    attract new customers. By optimizing your site for relevant keywords, you

  <h2>3. Websites Build Trust and Credibility</h2>

    According to <strong>HubSpot (2024)</strong>,
    <strong
      >75% of consumers judge a company’s credibility based on its website
      design</strong
    >. A well-structured, professional website reassures visitors that your
    business is legitimate and reliable, increasing their likelihood of reaching
    out.

    <li>Customer testimonials and case studies</li>

  <h2>4. Websites Enhance Social Media and Advertising Efforts</h2>
  <p>
    Having a website amplifies your social media and paid advertising campaigns
    by giving users a place to learn more about your business. Running Facebook,
    Instagram, or Google Ads without a website limits your lead potential.
  </p>
  <h3>How a Website Supports Ads:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Landing pages designed for conversions</li>
    <li>Clear call-to-action (CTA) buttons</li>
    <li>Lead magnets like free eBooks or consultations</li>
    <li>Retargeting visitors who didn’t convert immediately</li>
  </ul>
