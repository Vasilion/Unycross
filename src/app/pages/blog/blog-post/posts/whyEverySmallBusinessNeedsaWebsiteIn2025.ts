  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In today's digital-first world, having a website is no longer optional for
    small businesses—it's essential. A professionally designed website helps
    establish credibility, attract new customers, and increase sales. Despite
    this,
    <strong>27% of small businesses still don’t have a website</strong> (Forbes,
    2024). If you're a small business owner, investing in a website can be one
    of the best decisions you make. Here’s why.

  <h2>2. Increases Visibility and Reach</h2>
  <p>
    With over
    <strong>5.3 billion people using the internet worldwide</strong> (Statista,

    Whether you run a local bakery, a consulting firm, or a landscaping service,
    a website allows potential customers to find you via search engines.
  </p>
  <h3>How to Optimize Your Website for Search (SEO):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use <strong>targeted keywords</strong> like “affordable website for small
      business.”

      Optimize for <strong>local SEO</strong> by claiming your
      <strong>Google Business Profile</strong>.
