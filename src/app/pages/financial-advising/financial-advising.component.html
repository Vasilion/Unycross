      <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
      <div class="story-text">
        <p class="story-intro">
          There's a moment, just one, when everything shifts—not because the
          world changes, but because you do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mine came at 25, not in some dramatic crisis, but in the quiet grip of
          a realization I couldn't unsee:
        </p>

        <p class="story-highlight">
          I was going to spend the rest of my life working a job I hated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not for a season. Not as a stepping stone. But forever—unless
          something changed. It was a regular weekday, the kind where the
          morning commute feels like a sentence. I remember sitting in the
          parking lot before clocking in, engine off, hands on the wheel. The
          kind of silence that presses down on you. I wasn't burned out. I was
          numb. The kind of numb that whispers, "This is it. Get used to it."
        </p>

        <p>But I couldn't. I wouldn't.</p>

        <p>
          That moment—lonely, heavy, and almost too quiet—became the pivot point
          of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, I made a decision. Not a resolution. Not a hope. A
          decision—to understand money, to rewire my relationship with it, and
          to engineer a future that didn't feel like a treadmill. I was done
          grinding without direction. My wife and I deserved better.
        </p>

        <p>
          I threw myself into it: economic cycles, market behavior, political
          policy, global trends. I didn't want to be rich just for the sake of
          wealth—I wanted freedom. I wanted to stop trading time for dollars and
          start building something with leverage and intention.
        </p>

        <p>And slowly, the gears began to turn.</p>

        <p>
          Year by year, piece by piece, the numbers began to shift. From red to
          black. From flat to compounding. What felt impossible at 24 became
          undeniable by 30. A seven-figure net worth. Built not from luck or
          inheritance, but from clarity, discipline, and a plan that saw past
          the noise.
