im building a portfolio type website and have threejs as a background. My sites main theme colors are '#00d9ff' and '#6b40a0'. Generate me a unique threejs background using these colors. Key word, UNIQUE, I dont want something someone else has.


HTML

  <div
    #bgContainer
    style="
      position: fixed;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      z-index: -1;
    "
  ></div>

  CSS

  :host {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}

JS 

import * as THREE from 'three';

export class CyberpunkBackground {}


feel free to make changes as needed to the html or css, but u should just need to change the 3js code really. Make sure it works on mobile, so the canvas needs to be large enough to account for that so I dont get the white screen bug. I dont want any scrolling affects, and i want the behavior to be the same on mobile and desktop realtively.
